I'm a first-year PhD student at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Israel, where I am supervised by Prof. Omri Weinstein.

My broad research interests are:
- Algebraic Computation
- Optimization
- Algorithm Design

In this website I'm also maintaining a technical blog, in which I write summaries or walkthroughs of certain concepts and papers that I come across and find interesting. These are problems and concepts that I encounter throughout my research. **I do not claim any originality**, but I do hope to present these subjects in a useful and clear way.
